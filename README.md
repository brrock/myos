# Yosild - Your simple Linux distro

Yosild is a single shell script that builds a full, minimal Linux distribution,
based on BusyBox. It compiles the **stable kernel** 5.16.19 and the
**latest stable version of the BusyBox** 1.34.1. This script can prepare
minimalistic Linux system for devices with little hardware resources. Yosild Linux
needs just **70 MB RAM** and **40 MB storage size**. *yosild.sh* requires
[minimal][1] *Debian* or *Ubuntu* distro to run with the architecture compatible
with the target device.
