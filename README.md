# MyOS - Your simple Linux distro

MyOS is a single shell script that builds a full, minimal Linux distribution,
based on BusyBox. It compiles the **stable kernel**  and the
**git version of the BusyBox** . This script can prepare
minimalistic Linux system for devices with little hardware resources. MyOS Linux
needs just **70 MB RAM** and **40 MB storage size**. *MyOS.sh* requires
[minimal][1] *Debian* or *Ubuntu* distro to run with the architecture compatible
with the target device.
Note it currently doesnt work but will soon dont run the sricpt.
